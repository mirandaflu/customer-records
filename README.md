# Customer Records

We have some customer records in a text file (`customers.txt`) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office (`53.339428, -6.257664`) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
